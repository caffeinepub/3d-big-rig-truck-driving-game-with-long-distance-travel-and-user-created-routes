  "summary": "Diff implements major frontend world/visual upgrades: realistic road textures with markings overlay, enhanced deterministic power lines with raycast disabled, a more detailed truck model (per summary), NPC traffic with spawn/recycle behavior and raycast disabled, added highway + bridge/overpass meshes with guardrails, and a gas stop structure using generated metal textures. However, the diff summary does not show the required generated texture image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (only referenced in code). Also includes unrequested driving audio + mute state integration.",

      "requirement": "Add any newly generated textures as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and update the world/vehicle components to load and use them appropriately.",
      "reason": "Code references multiple new textures under /assets/generated (road v2 albedo/normal, road markings mask, guardrail albedo/normal, gas metal albedo/normal, pole wood textures), but the diff summary does not show any added image files under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
